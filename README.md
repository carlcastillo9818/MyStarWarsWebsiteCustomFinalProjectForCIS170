# MyStarWarsWebsiteCustomFinalProjectForCIS170
  A website (my final project) for my CIS 170 website and design class.  It utilizes my ideas from my sitemap that I created in assignment 2.  It also utilizes the wireframe that I made for the website (a blueprint of some sort).  The website will serve as something similar to wookiepedia or the main star wars website but on a much smaller scale as it will only focus on providing users with information on the Star Wars movie locations and characters.  There will also be a forum page to let users discuss those movie planets and characters to their hearts content.  (5-16-21 quick update, I managed to create everything including the main forum page but due to time running out, I made the links to the subforums unable to take the user to the individual forum pages.  The main forum page is available but not the subforums, perhaps I will go back and complete that part of the site  once I learn the other important web dev languages : javascript and PHP!
