# MyStarWarsWebsiteCustomFinalProjectForCIS170
  A website (to be my final project) for my CIS 170 website and design class.  It will utilize my ideas from my sitemap that I created in assignment 2.  It will also utilize the wireframe that I made for the website (a blueprint of some sort).  The website will serve as something similar to wookiepedia or the main star wars website EXCEPT it will only focus on providing users with information on the Star Wars movie locations and characters.  There will also be a forum page to let users discuss those movie planets and characters to their hearts content.  (5-16-21 quick update, I managed to create everything including the forum page but due to time running out, I made the links to the subforums unable to take the user to the individual forum pages.  The main forum page is available but not the subforums, perhaps I will go back and complete it or I'll just leave it like that and reuse the idea in another website.)
