# MyStarWarsWebsiteCustomFinalProjectForCIS170
  A website (my final project) for my CIS 170 website and design class. The website will serve as something similar to wookiepedia or the main star wars website but on a much smaller scale as it will only focus on providing users with information on the Star Wars movie locations and characters.  There will also be a forum page to let users discuss those movie planets and characters to their hearts content.
