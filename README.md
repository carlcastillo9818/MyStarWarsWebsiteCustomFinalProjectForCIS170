# MyStarWarsWebsiteCustomFinalProjectForCIS170
  A website (to be my final project) for my CIS 170 website and design class.  It will utilize my ideas from my sitemap that I created in assignment 2.  It will also utilize the wireframe that I made for the website (a blueprint of some sort).  The website will serve as something similar to wookiepedia or the main star wars website EXCEPT it will only focus on providing users with information on the Star Wars movie locations and characters.  There will also be a forum page to let users discuss those movie planets and characters to their hearts content.
