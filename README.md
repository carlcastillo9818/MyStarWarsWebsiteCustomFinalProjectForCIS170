# MyStarWarsWebsiteCustomFinalProjectForCIS170
A static website (my final project) for my CIS 170 website and design class. The website serves as something similar to wookiepedia or the main star wars website and it mainly focuses on providing users with information on the Star Wars movie locations and characters. In addition to the home page, contact page, and about page, there is   a forum page to let users discuss those movie planets and characters to their heart's content.
