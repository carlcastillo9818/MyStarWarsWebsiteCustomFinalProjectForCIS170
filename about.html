                <p>The mission of my website is to provide in depth information about the characters and locations of the mainline Star
                    Wars film saga (no spinoffs). By providing images, fun facts, and clips of the entities that exist in the Star Wars
                    films, my website will pass along great knowledge to Star Wars fans or even newcomers to the films. Visitors of the
                    website will learn interesting tidbits and see the characters in action. My website will also allow visitors to
                    explore
                    famous Star Wars movie locations and acquire facts about each location from each film. Theyâ€™ll also be able to
                    interact
                    with other users in a forum to discuss the films as they wish. By providing all of this information to visitors,
                    then my
                    website will accomplish its goal of educating people on the characters and locations of the Star Wars universe that
                    is
                    shown in the films.</p>
